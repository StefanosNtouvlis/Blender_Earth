# Earth Rotation Animation Project

Hello fellow explorers! üåç Welcome to the GitHub repository for my latest Blender project ‚Äì an awe-inspiring animation featuring the Earth itself. üöÄ

## Overview

In this project, I've ventured into the realms of 3D animation to bring the Earth to life with accurate depiction of day and night cycles, coupled with a simple yet mesmerizing rotation. Additionally, I've incorporated background sounds captured by NASA's satellites, providing an immersive experience of our planet's dynamic existence.

## Features

- **Realistic Day and Night Cycle:** Accurate representation of the Earth's illuminated and darkened halves, showcasing the interplay of light and shadow.

- **Rotation Animation:** Experience a captivating animation as the Earth gracefully rotates, offering a unique perspective of our celestial home.

- **NASA Satellite Sounds:** Immerse yourself in the ambiance of space with background sounds recorded by NASA's satellites, adding an extra layer of authenticity.

## How to Experience

1. **Requirements:** Ensure you have Blender installed on your machine.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/EarthRotationAnimation.git
   ```

3. **Open in Blender:**
   - Launch Blender 4.0.
   - Open the project file: `earth.blend`.
   - Experiment

4. **Enjoy the Animation:**
   - Open the animation file `earthanimation.blend`.
   - Witness the Earth's mesmerizing rotation and observe the dynamic transitions between day and night.

5. **Listen to NASA Sounds:**
   - Enjoy the background sounds captured by NASA's satellites, enhancing the overall experience.
