Earth Rotation Animation Project
Hello fellow explorers! üåç Welcome to the GitHub repository for my latest Blender project ‚Äì an awe-inspiring animation featuring the Earth itself. üöÄ

Overview
In this project, I've ventured into the realms of 3D animation to bring the Earth to life with accurate depiction of day and night cycles, coupled with a simple yet mesmerizing rotation. Additionally, I've incorporated background sounds captured by NASA's satellites, providing an immersive experience of our planet's dynamic existence.

Features
